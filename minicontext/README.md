# MiniContext - React App with Context API

This project is a simple implementation of **React Context API** to manage global state, like user authentication, across components without prop drilling. The app demonstrates a login form with a "Profile" page, showing how data flows from context and can be accessed by any child component.

## 🚀 Features

- **Context API**: Simplifies state management without needing external libraries like Redux.
- **Login/Logout Simulation**: Demonstrates how to set a user's state and display it across pages.
- **User Profile Page**: Displays the logged-in user's profile with a fancy font.
- **Responsive UI**: Works across devices with a simple, clean interface.
