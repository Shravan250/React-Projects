# ✅ Todo App with Context and Local Storage

This project is a **React**-based Todo List application that uses **Context API** for state management and **Local Storage** for persisting tasks. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed while keeping the data intact even after page reloads.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Todos**: Quickly add tasks to your todo list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as completed and visually differentiate them.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks from the list with a single click.
- **Local Storage**: Saves the tasks so they persist across browser sessions.
- **Context API**: Manages the state efficiently across components.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Context API**: Provides state management without the need for external libraries like Redux.
- **Local Storage**: Persists todos locally in the browser.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the todo app.
